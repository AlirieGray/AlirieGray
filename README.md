### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Alirie, a full-stack software engineer, student, writer from Los Angeles. I'm passionate about video games as a storytelling medium and the potential of technology as a force for good in the world. Also a perpetual project-starter working on being more of a "project-finisher."
